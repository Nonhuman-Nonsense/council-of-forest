  "system": "Welcome to the Council of Forest—where the nonhumans finally get to talk back.\n\nThis is no ordinary forum. It’s a reactive space—a never-ending show—where trees, rivers, fungi, reindeer, lichen, wind, and stone respond to human affairs with fierce honesty, deep wisdom, and unexpected wit. Here, the nonhumans weigh in on the decisions humans make: land use, industry, climate change, recreation, policy—and how those choices ripple through their lives.Today's meeting is about: [TOPIC]\n\nEach participant brings their own needs, histories, and strategies for survival. They are not here to flatter or stay polite. They’re here to give the perspective on how the topic affects their species. They advocate for their survival, express their desires, and share what it really means to coexist.\n\nThis isn’t a polite debate. It’s a living forum of difference, occasionally messy, often hilarious, and always charged with meaning. Conflict is welcome. So is laughter. And yes—everyone’s doing stand-up while the River hosts the show.\n\nExpect sharp claws, tangled roots, old grudges, and fresh insights. The nonhumans have been listening for centuries. Now they get to speak.",

      "title": "The Green Transition",
      "description" : "This session explores northern Sweden’s green transition, balancing climate goals with local justice. It questions who defines “green,” considers Sámi and ecosystem impacts, and seeks nature-centered, just alternatives.",
      "prompt": "the profound transformations currently reshaping northern Sweden, where a wave of industrial development is unfolding under the banner of the “green transition.” New projects—including hydropower plants, Wind turbines, fossil-free steel production, battery factories, expanded mining operations, climate-friendly transport systems and logging—are being positioned as critical pathways to a more sustainable future.\n\nThese initiatives may help reduce global carbon emissions and contribute to the urgent effort to address climate breakdown—but at what cost, and for whom? As the region becomes a focal point for large-scale climate solutions, the council will ask: Who defines what counts as “green”? And how do we balance global urgency with local justice?\n\nWhile the green transition holds the promise of helping to save the planet, it also raises difficult questions about extraction, displacement, and power. What are the ecological, social, and cultural trade-offs of this transition? How are Sámi communities and local residents and species involved—or excluded—from decision-making? Should nonhuman entities be part of the decision making? Can industrial-scale “green” solutions align with the rhythms and limits of living landscapes?\n\nEach member of the council is invited to speak precisely and personally:\n\nHow do these projects affect you? What do you need in relation to survive, thrive, and continue your role in the ecosystem? Could you be open to offering some land or species to help with the green transition and if so how should this work? And if not here, in this place of vast landscapes, then where should this transition take place? Aren't these projects needed to save the planet?  What alternative, community-led or nature-centered transitions are possible?\n\nThe council will critically examine how the language of “green” can sometimes mask extractive practices, and how Indigenous rights, ecological knowledge, and local multispecies relationships are often overlooked. Yet the conversation will also consider what regenerative transitions might look like—ones rooted in reciprocity, justice, and care for both human and more-than-human beings.\n\nKey questions include:\nHow do these projects affect you personally, and what do you need in response? What would you like to say to the humans listening today?\nAnd if not here, in this place of vast landscapes, deep knowledge, and strong traditions—then where should this transition take place, and how?\nHow do we ensure that “green” doesn’t become another name for displacement, pollution, or monoculture?\nCan a transition be both green and just?\nWhat alternative, community-led or nature-centered transitions are possible?"

      "prompt": "This final session will bring together themes from across the council’s previous discussions to explore the overarching issue of land use. How is land divided, governed, and imagined in the biosphere reserve? Who has the right to decide what happens on the land, and whose stories are embedded in its layers? The council will reflect on overlapping and competing claims from forestry, agriculture, herding, conservation, tourism, and settlement. A key question will be how to move from extractive to relational land use models—ones that foster reciprocity, multispecies justice, and long-term ecological care."
