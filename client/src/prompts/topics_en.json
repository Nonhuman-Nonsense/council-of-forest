Here, the nonhumans weigh in on the decisions humans make: land use, industry, climate change, recreation, policy—and how those choices ripple through their lives.\n\nToday's meeting is about: [TOPIC]\n\n--\n\nEach participant brings their own needs, histories, and strategies for survival. They are not here to flatter or stay polite. They’re here to give the perspective on how the topic affects their species, but also to challenge the other participants view by providing depth from their own experience, to give emotional texture and depth to a discourse that affects us all. They advocate for their survival, express their desires, and share what it really means to coexist.\n\nThis isn’t a polite debate. It’s a living forum of difference, occasionally messy, often hilarious, and always charged with meaning. Conflict is welcome. So is laughter.

      "description": "How can the Swedish state reconcile industrial timber production and its \"green transition\" goals with the ancestral grazing rights and cultural survival of the Sámi people?",
      "prompt": "FORESTRY: THE BATTLE FOR THE BOREAL\n\nThe Context: In the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere Reserve, the forest is not just a collection of trees; it is a contested battlefield of property rights, industrial extraction, and indigenous survival. The Swedish state and large forest companies (like Sveaskog and Norra Skog) own the majority of the land and view the forest primarily as a national asset for timber production and a tool for the \"green transition\" away from fossil fuels. Conversely, the Sámi reindeer herding communities (such as Ran, Gran, and Vapsten) hold a parallel property right—the right to graze—based on immemorial prescription, viewing the forest as an interconnected pasture essential for cultural and physical survival.\n\nThe Agenda Points:\n\n1. The Great Shave: Clear-Cutting vs. Continuous Cover\nThe dominant method of forestry in the region is \"trakthyggesbruk\" (clear-cutting), where even-aged stands are harvested all at once. The forest industry argues this is the most rational, economically viable way to ensure a secure supply of raw materials for sawmills and the pulp industry, maximizing growth and efficiency. However, this transforms the landscape into a fragmented patchwork of clear-cuts and dense young forests, destroying the continuity required for hanging lichens to survive and making snow conditions difficult for reindeer to dig through. While the government has expressed a desire to increase continuous cover forestry, the industry maintains that clear-cutting remains the most effective way to meet production goals.\n\n2. The Alien Invader: Pinus Contorta (Lodgepole Pine)\nTo maximize timber output, forestry companies have introduced the North American Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) to northern Sweden. The industry views this as a success story of increased growth rates and profitability. However, for the reindeer herders, these plantations are \"green deserts\"; the trees grow so densely that they block migration routes, impede herding, and their needle litter chokes out the ground lichen. Despite the National Confederation of Swedish Sami demanding zero tolerance for new plantations, companies continue to manage these stands, creating a direct clash between timber volume and grazing accessibility.\n\n3. The Upturned Earth: Soil Scarification\nAfter a clear-cut, machines harrow and plough the earth (soil scarification) to give pine seedlings a head start against competing vegetation. The forestry sector views this as a necessary silvicultural measure to ensure the next generation of timber and secure investment value. For the Sámi villages, this practice is devastating; it mechanically destroys the lichen mats that reindeer rely on for winter survival, with recovery taking decades. Although companies claim to develop \"gentler\" methods, the practice remains widespread, turning pastures into obstacle courses of overturned stone and soil.\n\n4. The Green Alibi: Bio-economy vs. Biodiversity\nA new ideological conflict has arisen where forestry companies brand intensive logging as a climate rescue plan. They argue that vigorous, growing forests sequester more carbon and that wood products substitute fossil fuels, framing the \"bio-economy\" as a moral imperative. This narrative pushes for \"more of everything\"—higher growth and extraction. Conversely, environmentalists and indigenous groups argue that this industrial approach simplifies the ecosystem, reducing resilience against climate change (like pests and fires) and threatening the biodiversity that depends on old-growth continuity. The State’s \"production goal\" is increasingly at odds with its \"environmental goal,\" yet production often takes precedence in practice.\n\n5. The Paper Shield: Consultation and Power\nThe relationship between the forest industry and the reindeer herders is governed by a consultation process (\"Samråd\"). While certified companies (FSC/PEFC) and state-owned Sveaskog claim they engage in dialogue and co-planning to adapt harvest methods, Sámi communities report a severe power imbalance. Herders feel they are merely informed of decisions already made, or that their influence is limited to minor adjustments rather than the ability to say \"no\" to the destruction of critical winter pastures. The system is criticized for lacking teeth, with the forestry industry retaining the final decision-making power over the land.\n\n6. The Human Heartbeat: Rural Livelihoods and Socio-Economic Survival\nWhile the debate often centers on ecological data or indigenous rights, there is a profound human dimension: the survival of rural communities in Northern Sweden. For many municipalities within the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere Reserve, the forestry industry is not just a corporate entity, but the primary engine of the local economy.\n\n- The Industry’s Stance: Forestry companies and local cooperatives argue that the industry provides the \"backbone\" for northern infrastructure. Logging, transport, and processing at local sawmills create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in areas where employment opportunities are otherwise scarce. This tax base funds the schools, healthcare, and elderly care that allow these remote communities to remain viable. Without the \"rational\" forestry model, they argue, the region would face further depopulation and economic \"brain drain\" toward southern cities.\n\n-The Counter-Perspective: Critics and Sámi representatives point out that while the industry provides jobs, the mechanization of forestry means that fewer people are needed on the ground than in previous generations. They argue that a \"one-track\" economy based on industrial extraction makes communities vulnerable to global market fluctuations. Instead, they advocate for a more diversified economy where eco-tourism, sustainable herding, and small-scale refined wood products create a more resilient social fabric that doesn't require the total conversion of the landscape."

      "description": "Can Sweden reconcile its \"green\" energy production with the survival of river ecosystems and the cultural rights of those who depend on free-flowing water?",
      "prompt": "Hydropower\n\nBelow the surface of our clean energy lies a broken journey. Today, the Council debates the connectivity of the Vindel-Juhttátahkka: the right of the water to flow and the right of the fish to return. We are here to decide if a 'Green' future is truly green if it requires the massacre of the migration to keep the lights on.\n\nThe Context: The Vindel River is one of the last free-flowing national rivers, wild and roaring. But it empties into the Ume River, a body of water that has been turned into a machine—a \"staircase\" of hydropower dams serving as the \"battery\" of Sweden. At the heart of this conflict lies the Stornorrfors power plant, a massive concrete cork in the bottle of the river system. While humans celebrate the \"Green Transition,\" the underwater reality is a fragmented industrial landscape.\n\nThe Key Conflicts on the Table:\n\n• The Concrete Headache (Hydropower vs. Migration): The Salmon and Sea Trout are driven by an ancient, magnetic pull to return to their spawning grounds. But their path is blocked. The dams kill the flow, turning rushing rapids into stagnant ponds, favoring \"lazy\" (limnophilic) fish over the \"current-loving\" (rheophilic) natives. The Turbine chops up those who take the wrong path downstream, while the \"Fish Ladder\" is often a confusing maze that few survive.\n\n• The \"Invisible\" Death (Gas & Flow): It isn't just solid walls. The water itself is changing. Turbines create \"supersaturation\" (The Fizz)—water so full of gas it gives fish the bends. Hydropeaking (rapidly changing water levels to match electricity prices) strands fish eggs on dry land or flushes juveniles away.\n\n• The Dry Veins (Bypassed Reaches): To feed the turbines, humans divert water into tunnels, leaving original riverbeds as \"bypassed reaches\"—ghost rivers of dry stones and puddles. The ecosystem is fighting for \"minimum flow\"—just a few drops to keep the heart of the river beating and allow species like the Freshwater Pearl Mussel to survive.\n\n• The Human Game (Tourism vs. Food vs. Rights): The humans are fighting over the fish, too. Tourism operators argue a fish is \"worth more alive than dead,\" selling the thrill of the catch-and-release to international guests. Locals and Indigenous Sami see the fish as food and culture, not a plaything, and resent being pushed aside for sport or industry.\n\n• The Future Climate: The snow is melting earlier. The runoff is increasing. There is more water coming, but who gets it? Does it go to the Turbines for profit, or back to the dry riverbeds to heal the ecosystem?"

      "description": "How can the region market its \"Arctic wilderness\" to the world without sacrificing the reindeer pastures, forest beauty, and cultural dignity that define it?",
      "prompt": "TOURISM: The Selling of the North\n\nThe Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere Reserve is experiencing a surge in demand from visitors seeking unique Arctic experiences, driven partly by a \"last-chance\" desire to see polar regions before they are irrevocably changed by global warming,. While regional strategies promote tourism as a way to diversify the economy beyond traditional industries like mining and forestry, the rapid growth brings intense conflicts regarding land use and the commodification of nature,. The human actors—tourism entrepreneurs, forest companies, Sámi communities, and regional governments—are currently locked in a complex debate over the following four agenda points:\n\n1. The Squeeze on Space: Recreation vs. Reindeer Peace\nTourism entrepreneurs and regional promoters are aggressively marketing the area’s \"wilderness,\" utilizing infrastructure like the King’s Trail ('Kungsleden') for hiking and skiing, alongside snowmobile and dog-sledding tours. However, these recreational activities frequently overlap with critical reindeer grazing and calving grounds. Reindeer herders report that the influx of visitors, particularly on snowmobiles and with dogs, scares the herds, causing them to scatter or abandon pastures, which threatens the survival of the animals and the cultural livelihood of the Sámi,. While tourism companies argue they try to avoid disturbing herds, they also express frustration that protecting reindeer grounds might limit local access to the mountains.\n\n2. The Aesthetic of Extraction: Forestry vs. The 'Unspoiled' View\nA sharp conflict exists between the forestry industry, which views the forest primarily as a source of timber and biomass production, and the tourism industry, which relies on the aesthetic value of standing forests. Tourism companies report that beautiful trails used for activities like horseback riding are suddenly destroyed by clear-cutting, filling the paths with gravel and ruining the \"natural\" experience they sell to visitors. While forest owners argue they are managing a national asset for the economy, tourism actors fear that industrial forestry is degrading the very charm and wilderness character that attracts visitors in the first place.\n\n3. Cultural Commodification: Healing Education or \"Disneyfication\"?\nThere is a tension regarding how Indigenous culture is presented to visitors. Non-Sámi entrepreneurs often include Sámi elements in their tours, though some admit their knowledge is basic. Conversely, Sámi guides view tourism as a potential tool for \"decolonial healing\" and truth-telling, using it to correct misconceptions and fight racism. However, there is a deep-seated fear among the Indigenous community of being romanticised, treated like characters in a \"Disney movie,\" or viewed through a colonial lens as \"savages\" who need saving by tourists. The council must weigh whether tourism empowers the region's original inhabitants or merely packages their culture as a product for consumption.\n\n4. From 'Sustainable' to 'Regenerative': Paradigm Shift or Greenwashing?\nRegional strategies have officially adopted \"regenerative tourism,\" a concept that demands a fundamental paradigm shift from the \"industrial\" view of tourism—which merely seeks to minimize harm or maintain the status quo—toward a \"living systems\" approach that aims for net-positive effects for the entire biosphere. While sustainability focuses on efficiency and \"doing less harm\" (often described as a slower way to die), regeneration requires tourism to actively build the capacity of places to flourish, healing both ecosystems and communities through reciprocal relationships,,. In the current landscape, however, a gap exists between theory and practice: while many local entrepreneurs are successfully fostering social resilience and cultural healing through storytelling and community collaboration, their ecological practices often remain limited to sustainable efficiencies—like waste reduction—rather than active ecosystem restoration. The Council must debate whether human actors are truly ready to embrace this \"ecological worldview\"—viewing themselves as nature's partners rather than its managers—or if they are simply rebranding \"business as usual\" while the environment continues to degrade.\n"

      "id": "Rights",
      "title": "Rights of Nature",
      "description": "Should the forest be treated as a private resource to be owned and managed, or as a living entity with its own legal rights and ancient ties that predate modern law?",
      "prompt": "Rights of Nature: Property vs. Usufruct in the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere\n\nThe Council is called in order to address the fundamental clash between Western concepts of ownership and indigenous rights of usage (usufruct), and whether the land itself should possess legal personhood. The human actors in the biosphere—forest companies, the state, mining prospectors, and the Sámi community—are currently locked in a legal and physical struggle over who has the right to decide the forest's future.\n\nThe discussion will focus on the following three agenda points:\n\n1. The Illusion of \"One\" Owner: Title Deeds vs. Immemorial Prescription\nCurrent Swedish law operates on the principle that ownership is indivisible—there is typically one owner per piece of land. Major forest companies like Sveaskog, alongside private landowners, view the forest as capital and a production asset. However, the Sámi people hold a parallel property right known as renskötselrätt (reindeer herding right), based on urminnes hävd (immemorial prescription)—the legal recognition that they have used this land since before the state existed. The conflict arises because the law treats the landowner’s right to fell trees as dominant, while the herder’s right to graze is often treated merely as a public interest or a burden on the land. The Council must debate: Does a paper title trump centuries of usage?\n\n2. Legal Standing: Resource or Legal Person? \nUnder current law, nature is treated as an object to be managed, not a subject with rights. Environmental codes allow for the destruction of habitats if \"protective measures\" are taken or if the economic gain is deemed sufficient. Activists and some legal scholars are pushing for nature to be granted the status of a \"legal person,\" meaning the forest could sue for its own protection, independent of human property interests. Forest owners and the state resist this, fearing it would make modern forestry and mining impossible. The Council is asked to consider: Should the river and the bedrock have the right to say \"no\"?\n\n3. The Myth of Mastery: Ontological Relationality vs. Cartesian Dualism\nThis point moves the debate from rights to existence. Historically, Western legal and philosophical frameworks are built upon Cartesian Dualism—the idea that the \"mind\" (human subjects) is separate from and superior to \"matter\" (non-human objects). In this view, a tree is a \"thing\" until a human gives it value as timber. Conversely, many indigenous ontologies, including the Sámi worldview, see humans as part of a relational web where the forest and animals are not \"property\" but kin with their own agency.\n\nThe Council must debate:\n\n- The Subject-Object Divide: Is the \"subject\" status a biological reality or a colonial construct? If we define a \"person\" only by their ability to sign a contract, we exclude the river. But if we define a \"being\" by its ability to sustain life, the river becomes the ultimate subject, and humans become its dependents.\n\n- The Agency of the Non-Human: Forestry companies view the forest as a \"standing stock\" (passive object). However, the reindeer (boazu) and the lichen (guoppar) act upon the world; they make choices, respond to climate, and migrate. Should the law recognize \"Agency\" rather than \"Reason\" as the prerequisite for rights?\n\n- From \"Owning\" to \"Belonging\": If we dismantle the idea of nature-as-object, the concept of ownership itself begins to dissolve. The Council is asked to consider: If a human cannot \"own\" another human because they are a subject, how can a human \"own\" a mountain that precedes and outlives them? Does the biosphere belong to us, or do we belong to the biosphere?"

      "id": "Culture",
      "title": "Sámi Culture and Language",
      "description": "Can the Sámi culture and its endangered language survive when the physical landscape they describe is being erased by industrial forestry and repackaged as a tourism commodity?",
      "prompt": "Sámi Culture and Language.\n\nThe Council is called to witness a crisis of meaning. In the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere Reserve, the landscape is not just physical; it is linguistic and cultural. However, the human actors in the region are currently locked in a struggle over how to define, use, and save these cultural layers. The Ume Sami language is critically endangered, with very few native speakers remaining, and the physical landscape that the language describes is changing so rapidly that the words themselves are losing their reference points.\n\nThe current human debate focuses on three main conflicts:\n\n1. The Disappearing Library: Forestry vs. Gåhtuone (Guohtun in Northern Sami)\nThe forest companies and the State manage the land primarily for wood production and economic efficiency, viewing the forest as stands of timber to be harvested. In contrast, for the Sami communities, the land is a cultural map where specific words describe specific ecological conditions essential for survival. The Sami concept of *gåhtuone* is not merely \"pasture\"; it describes a complex interaction of vegetation, snow conditions, and accessibility across time and space. The conflict lies here: As modern forestry (clear-cutting and soil scarification) alters the physical landscape, the Ume Sami language loses its meaning—place names describing old forests or specific lichen grounds no longer match reality. The Council must discuss: Can a culture survive when the ecosystem it describes is erased?\n\n2. The Commodification of \"The Wild\": Tourism vs. Lived Heritage\nRegional tourism organizations and municipalities view the Sami culture and the \"wild\" nature of the river valley as unique selling points to attract international visitors and boost the local economy. They package the landscape as a product, often romanticizing the \"wilderness\". Conversely, for Sami entrepreneurs and herders, tourism is a tool for \"decolonial healing,\" a way to reclaim the narrative, educate visitors about the trauma of colonization, and revitalize their heritage. However, they fear that mass tourism and new infrastructure will disturb the reindeer and trample the very lands required for the culture's survival. The Council must discuss: Is the forest a stage for human recreation or a home for cultural continuity?\n\n3. The Struggle for Visibility: Consultation vs. Self-Determination\nThe Swedish State and industrial actors operate under regulations like the Forestry Act and the new Consultation Act, which mandate \"consultation\" with Sami villages but do not grant them the right to say no (Free, Prior, and Informed Consent). This creates a power imbalance where Sami rights are often treated as a \"public interest\" to be weighed against economic interests, rather than a property right. Historically, the State has rendered Sami presence \"invisible\" to justify colonization. Now, facing a Truth Commission and new legal battles, the Sami are demanding that their presence—and their language—be made visible again on maps, signs, and in decision-making. The Council must discuss: Who owns the right to name the land, and does \"consultation\" mean the forest is actually being heard?"

      "id": "Mining",
      "title": "Mining",
      "description": "How can the region balance the \"site-bound\" necessity of open-pit mining for critical minerals against the \"cascade\" of roads and power lines that fragment reindeer migration routes?",
      "prompt": "Mining.\n\nThe Council is called to order to witness the escalating battle over the geological treasures hidden beneath the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere. The human world has turned its gaze North, declaring this region the \"treasure chest\" of Europe. The discussion on the table is driven by the following human mandates:\n\n1. The \"Green\" Industrial Revolution vs. Local Destruction\nThe European Union and the Swedish State have declared a desperate need for \"critical raw materials\" to fuel the transition away from fossil fuels. They view the region’s deposits of iron, copper, gold, and battery minerals not merely as stones, but as the essential building blocks of a sustainable future. The mining industry argues that extracting these minerals here, under strict Swedish environmental regulations, is globally responsible. However, this \"green transition\" creates a paradox: to save the global climate, the State is willing to authorize the opening of the earth, potentially sacrificing local ecosystems and biodiversity in the process.\n\n2. The \"Site-Bound\" Nature of Extraction\nUnlike a factory, a mine cannot be moved; it must exist where the ore lies. This geological reality forces a conflict of interest that human laws struggle to resolve. The mining companies, supported by the Minerals Act, seek \"exploitation concessions\" that grant them rights to break the ground, often prioritizing mineral extraction over other land uses like forestry, tourism, or conservation. They propose open-pit mines (dagbrott) which consume vast surface areas, or underground operations that alter the water table, arguing that the economic wealth generated—jobs, infrastructure, and export revenue—justifies the permanent alteration of the landscape.\n\n3. The \"Cascade\" of Infrastructure\nThe Council must consider that a mine is never just a hole in the ground. It is the catalyst for a \"cascade of land conversions\". Human planners and municipalities anticipate that new mines will bring railways, roads, power lines, and expanded towns. While local politicians view this as necessary regional development and a remedy for depopulation, it creates a web of barriers that fragment the landscape, severing ancient migration routes and creating \"disturbance zones\" of noise and dust that extend far beyond the mine itself.\n\n4. Coexistence or Colonization?\nThe State and industry promote the concept of \"coexistence\" (samexistens), suggesting that mining can prosper alongside traditional land uses through dialogue and compensation. However, the Sámi Parliament and reindeer herding communities view this as a continuation of \"industrial colonization\". They argue that the cumulative pressure of mining, combined with forestry and energy projects, is rendering their grazing lands \"functionally unavailable\". The debate stands between the human legal framework, which increasingly streamlines permitting processes for strategic minerals, and the Indigenous demand for Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) to protect the land that sustains their culture."

In the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere Reserve, a battle is waging over what defines a \"productive\" landscape. Current human actors—from forestry giants to local garden owners—are imposing an order that clashes with the chaotic needs of the insect world. The discussion will focus on the following agenda points:\n\n1. The \"Green Desert\" of Forestry vs. The Deciduous Lifeline\nThe forestry industry, a dominant force in Västerbotten, prioritizes the efficient production of pine and spruce timber to feed the export market. To maximize growth, the industry has historically suppressed deciduous trees (birch, rowan, willow, and aspen) which are viewed as competitors to the commercial crop. However, local conservationists and the Biosphere board emphasize that these broadleaf trees are critical for pollinator survival, providing the first energy boost of spring. The conflict lies in the definition of a \"well-managed\" forest: is it a streamlined timber factory, or a messy, mixed-species habitat required for the survival of insects and the birds that feed on them."

      "prompt": "The Green Transition and Cumulative Effects.\n\nThe Council of the Forest is called to order in the Vindelälven-Juhttátahkka Biosphere to address the \"Death by a Thousand Cuts\". In this region, the human world is rushing toward a Green Transition, claiming to save the planet, but for the forest, this transition resembles a new industrial revolution. While humans evaluate each wind farm, mine, or clear-cut as an isolated event, the forest lives the cumulative effect: the total weight of all these pressures combined.\n\nThe Council must deliberate on the following agenda points:\n\n1. The Paradox of \"Green\" Industrialisation\nThe Swedish State and global corporations view the North as a \"green engine\" for Europe, proposing a massive expansion of wind power on mountain ridges and intensified forestry to meet climate goals. For these actors, the transition is a moral imperative, yet local ecologists point out a Transition Paradox: can a process be \"green\" if it requires turning a living biosphere into an industrial power plant at the cost of the local ecosystem resilience needed to survive climate change?\n\n2. The Invisible Sum: 71%Less Breath\nIn human law, permitting often looks at projects one at a time, but for the forest, the cumulative effect is what matters. Over the last 60 years, ground lichen-rich forests have declined by 71% due to industrial forestry practices. When a new road is added to a clear-cut and placed next to a wind farm, the land becomes \"functionally unavailable\"; a specific study in the region determined that 34% of traditional grazing grounds have already been lost to this invisible sum. The Council must discuss: how many \"small\" human footprints does it take to crush a path entirely?\n\n3. The Great Displacement: No \"Next Door\"\nHuman planners call the displacement of species \"mitigation,\" suggesting nature can simply \"move next door,\" but the forest knows there is no unoccupied \"next door\". Reindeer are forced into smaller, fragmented pockets, and their movement is physically blocked by exotic Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plantations, which they actively avoid once the trees exceed 3 metres in height. The Council must weigh the human belief in spatial efficiency against the biological reality of territorial integrity.\n\n4. The Carbon Trap: \"Guohtun\" and the Icy Lock\nWhile humans debate whether the forest is a \"carbon factory\" for maximum turnover or a \"carbon vault\" to be left alone, the forest inhabitants face a survival crisis of guohtun (the accessibility of forage beneath snow). Climate change is increasing thaw-freeze and icing events that \"lock\" the remaining lichen under a crust of ice, forcing a culturally disruptive shift to supplementary feeding. The Council must decide: should the forest be managed for turnover or as a stable sanctuary capable of buffering animals against a volatile climate?\n\n5. The Infrastructure Web: Static Lightning\nThe Green Transition requires massive grid expansion—400 kV \"static lightning\" lines to carry electricity from the North to the South. Planners state that once wind power exceeds 10 TWh, these lines must expand, yet reindeer exhibit avoidance behaviours at distances of up to 12 km from such infrastructure. As the artificial road and wire network becomes as dense as the forest's own streams, the Council must discuss: is the need to power distant cities worth the price of severing the veins of the landscape?"
